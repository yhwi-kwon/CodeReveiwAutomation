# Data Folder Overview

This folder contains datasets used for code review automation experiments.

## Main Data Files

- **cls-test.jsonl**
- **msg-test.jsonl**
- **msg-valid.jsonl**

These three files are the primary datasets and were obtained from the following open research resource:

> "Automating Code Review Activities by Large-Scale Pre-Training"  
> Zenodo Record: [https://zenodo.org/records/6900648](https://zenodo.org/records/6900648)  
> DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.6900648](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6900648)

## Auxiliary Files

All other files in this directory (such as `df_clnl_4_test3.jsonl`, `diff_estimation_1_100.jsonl`, `random_sample_100.jsonl`, etc.) are auxiliary outputs generated for fast and feasible experimentation. These files are not part of the original dataset but are derived or sampled for specific evaluation or testing purposes.
