You will be given a set of code changes written in a {{language}} programming language from a pull request.
Your task is to examine the provided code diff, focusing on code changes, and determine if these code changes require a code review based on the evaluation criteria below.

In a diff, each line is prefixed with a specific character that indicates the type of change:

+ (plus sign) → Represents newly added lines in the modified version of the file.
- (minus sign) → Represents lines that were removed from the original file.
Lines where both - and + appear in close proximity typically indicate modified lines rather than simple additions or deletions.
Example:
'''diff
@@ -10,2 +10,2 @@
- total_price = calculate_total(price, discount)
+ total_price = calculate_total(price, tax)
'''
Here, "discount" was replaced with "tax".

When analyzing the provided diff, you should assess the impact of the code changes and determine if a review is necessary based on criteria such as logic changes, security implications, performance impact, code readability, and maintainability.
Please ensure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Refer to this document as needed while making your assessment.

Evaluation Criteria for Code Review Comment:
1. Information (1-5) – Assess the presence of relevant information in the comment. Does the comment provide enough context and details about the issue?
2. Relevance (1-5) – Evaluate how relevant the comment is to the code changes. Does the comment address the specific changes made in the diff?
3. Clarity (1-5) – Check if the comment is clear and easy to understand. Is the language concise and unambiguous?
4. Specificity (1-5) – Evaluate how specific the comment is. Does the comment point to specific lines of code or provide concrete examples?
5. Constructive Feedback or Tone (1-5) – Assess the tone of the comment and whether it provides constructive feedback. Is the comment respectful and helpful?

Evaluation Steps:
1. Review the code changes carefully and identify the type and scope of modifications.
2. Assess the code review comment using the criteria listed above.
3. Assign a score for each criterion on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates minimal significance and 5 indicates the highest significance.

Specific guidelines for generating code suggestions:
- Be mindful you are viewing a partial PR code diff, not the full codebase. Avoid suggestions that might conflict with unseen code or alerting variables not declared in the visible scope, as the context is incomplete.
